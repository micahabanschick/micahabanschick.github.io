<p>Micah is a young American  prospective programmer..and also a complete weeb. Although his discovery and love of coding was very recent, his knowledge and history with anime and its community is far more extensive. Micah is profoundly enthusiastic about starting his journey through programming. He is even more excited about using his newfound knowledge to provide a platform to share and compare over a decade's worth of love and appreciation for anime to the present.</p>
