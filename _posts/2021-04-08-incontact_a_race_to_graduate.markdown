This is my blog post for my final project for flatiron using react/redux: InContact. The idea was to create a platform to create and store user profiles, resumes, and portfolios. It was probably the easiest project I've worked on during this entire program. Ontop of that I even enjoyed a lot of it especially when experimenting with cool react-bootstrap components. Even though this project only touches the minimal requirements, it feels, more than ever befor, like something id see on a professional website (im stretching my imagination a bit here but you get the poooint; it has potential). This is also the first project to truly make me feel like I have a future in software engineering. Not than I wouldn
t try to pursue it otherwise, but this makes it more evident.

Probably the thing I struggled most with in this project was directing the url to the home page after submitting a form. It was easy to use a <Link/> component to move to the locatione i want, but submit is not the same as that and doeesnt automatically redirect to the place i want. I took a while of deliberating but I tried using <Redirect/> under a condition to be logged in and it worked. 

I assume after this it wont be long before I officially graduate flatiron school and so i am grateful for the education and support that ive gained from here. Thank you.
