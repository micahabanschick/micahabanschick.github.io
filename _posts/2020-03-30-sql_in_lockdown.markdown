And now I have begun the epic that is SQL. During a time where I am reluctant to leave the house, I train with databases...such fun. At first I was quite excited about starting a chapter with such relavance to professional programming. However, that excitement quickly died down as I went through too many variations of:
```
SELECT * FROM table
```
such as:
```
SELECT * FROM table WHERE a = b
```
or 
```
SELECT SUM(col1), col2 FROM table 
```
or 20 more. 


I honestly can't wait for a new project, because with the virus lockdown, life has become too monotonous for dreary lessons. If anything SQL represents a depressing parallel between our fixed lives and the database of the world. 

LOL. I'm no extrovert, but the last block is what happens when I'm left alone in isolation for too long...

If any program employees are required to read this, I am sorry and will make sure my next installment is more entertaining. Never say I don't think about the teachers :).
