General:
This project was a duzy. Not because the concept of the project was difficult to work with, but because of the problems that arose, such as with omniauth or.....well mostly omniauth. When following the lessons closesly most of the project went smoothly. Validations were little more than a cut and paste. Nested routes were simple to create. most checkboxes flew by without a hitch. But that damn omniauth....

App:
Most of this project relied upon some simple planning and outlining. After that was completed, it was just a lot of copy and paste. The forms were templated almost identically. The models were associated as simply as possible (excluding the extra models for the future). The controllers worked with 99% identical lines of code. Some issues arose one by one but at this point I've prioritized completing the program to creating a nice project. I can clean it up after I graduate. 

Omniaith:
This was by far my greatest challenge. I watched video after video. I read article after article. I tried method after method. Nothing seemed to work. Nothing seems to work STILL. I f someone can show me how to fix something as complicated as omniauth I'd greatly appreciate it. I'm stumped.

Future Updates:
Overall, it was a pretty cut and dry project which required less work the less I cared about making it "look pretty." After a LONG time of being stuck on it I just programmed the code that only "technically" checked off the boxes. I don't have much patience to spend so much time on something that I can't get help for. I left in many models and migrations for possible updates in the future. after I graduate from the program I'll likely clean up all my projects to look much nicer in my portfolio. For now I'm just leaving them in there so that I don't forget about them.


Hopefully I can speed through Javascript after this is verified. I've finally stopped caring about making it look nice and that will probably save me 50% of my time so that I can get through the rest. See ya in a few weeks for my Javascript Project post ;)
