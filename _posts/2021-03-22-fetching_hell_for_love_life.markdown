This is my blog post archiving my experience with the Javascript Portfolio Project. It was very simple but required fetch requests, the spawn of the devil. 99% of the application went fairly smoothly, but whenever I needed to render information from the backend I ran into trouble. Otherwise the project was a hitch. The requirements were few and simple. 

Although reluctantly, I did manage to become slightly more accustomed to asynchronous functions. 
However, for the majority of the projects's pitfalls, I suspect that react.js will help a bunch. I am one step closer to becoming a full stack web developer and that feels great. 

However, I do acknowledge that in the real world I'll be able to ask for help, even in these projects. The only thing holding me back is pride, and if I put my pride aside I can have a friend give me advise when I'm having trouble. I obviously is necessary in the learning process to go in alone, but I'm a social creature and am confident that I can work well with othters. 

All things said, this was probably the most useful project, in my opinion, in terms of creating useful applications for the real world. although I left much of my UI/UX in the dust, with that completed the application would be quite useful. Thank you Flatiron.
