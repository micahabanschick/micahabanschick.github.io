### I am a fairly stubborn fellow. Let's establish that before moving on. 

I took years to be convinced to try sauteed mushrooms, and even longer to try hard-boiled eggs (both of which foods only truly appealed to me as I started eating healthier). I only recently watched shows such as Re:Zero and No Game No Life, of which  I've been recommended repeatedly and heard numerous discussions about. I haven't even started Berserk (though I plan on it shortly).

It wasn't until my friends and family-membered became raw from encouraging me to take a good crack at coding that I actually listened. Again, I am referring to many years of urging me to try it.

### Now, fast-forward two months. 

I am a member of the current Flatiron cohert for Software Engineering.

### ...well, since this is a blog post, I might as well elaborate.

For the longest time, I've been pursuing nothing, nothing being the unknown goal I have meandered towards throughout college. I was on an accelerated engineering track at school, but, even there, I had no idea what I liked. I simply was doing it because STEM subjects were easier for me than many other people so I thought "I would make sense.."

And yet my mind constantly grapsped the air for better career ideas...like Saitama trying to swat a bug.

However, back then I lacked the discipline to do the work necessary to succeed, and always questioned what else I can do. Some time passed and I decided it didn't matter what I did, it just mattered that I did something to support myself. I then got a job and started working.

### THEN I TRIED TO CODE!!!

Bad timing right! Anyway, I'd guess it was the level of abstract thinking and logic involved that pulled me in. At first, it was a part-time hobby for after work. Later, it became something I put more hours into than work (I got no sleep). I've been at it ever since and don't plan on stopping. What I do plan on doing is eventually going back to school, this time with a direction. I want to work in the vanguard of technology and finish my engineering degree, this time in order to become a Machine-Learning Engineer.

## So now it's time to code..ready..set..GO!
